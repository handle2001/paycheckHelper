# paycheckHelper
GTK app that estimates federal withholding from paychecks
This application is a work in progress and is not yet functional, but once all the features have been implemented it will allow the user to input their gross pay and estimate how much will be withheld in payroll taxes. It is hoped this will be useful to employees who need to know how much their take home pay will (needs to) be so that they can plan a better budget.
